We’re transitioning to a new UI, and are in the process of updating our Webflow University content. If you have a Core, Growth, Agency, or Freelancer Workspace, or if your site has an active Site plan, you can add custom code and scripts that apply to your entire site or individual pages. This can be useful for adding additional HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. You can also use the Embed element to add custom blocks of HTML code to your site design or rich text elements.

As such, Webflow cannot guarantee the functionality or full compatibility of any custom code. Additionally, our support team is unable to provide direct help with custom code setup or troubleshooting, as these topics fall outside the scope of our customer support policy. If you run into issues with custom code, please let us know on the Webflow Forum, where the entire Webflow community (staff included) can provide additional help and resources.

Tags\r\nImportant\r\n\r\nIf your custom code has opening and/or closing tags, make sure to add those to ensure your code works as expected. Additionally, don’t include <html>, <body>, or <head> tags in your custom code, or your website/layout will break. Link tag: <link> \r\nThe <link> tag defines a link between a document and an external resource and should always go in the <head> code section.

Style tags: <style></style>\r\nThe <style></style> tag defines additional CSS styles in your site and should always go in the <head> code section. Script tags: <script></script>\r\nThe <script></script> tag allows you to embed JavaScript in your site and can be added to either the <head> code section or before the closing </body> tag (i.e., the Footer code section). However, adding your <script></script> tags just before the closing </body> tag ensures your site pages load all their content before the JavaScript is processed, which helps with page load speed and provides a better user experience.
