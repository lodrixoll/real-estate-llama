Form AD, Revised 12/21)\r\n (If checked) This form is being provided in connection with a transaction for a leasehold interest exceeding one year as per Civil\r\nCode section 2079.13(j), (k), and (l). When you enter into a discussion with a real estate agent regarding a real estate transaction, you should from the outset understand\r\nwhat type of agency relationship or representation you wish to have with the agent in the transaction. SELLER'S AGENT\r\nA Seller's agent under a listing agreement with the Seller acts as the agent for the Seller only. A Seller's agent or a subagent of that\r\nagent has the following affirmative obligations:\r\nTo the Seller: A Fiduciary duty of utmost care, integrity, honesty and loyalty in dealings with the Seller. To the Buyer and the Seller:\r\n(a) Diligent exercise of reasonable skill and care in performance of the agent's duties. (b) A duty of honest and fair dealing and good faith. (c) A duty to disclose all facts known to the agent materially affecting the value or desirability of the property that are not known to,\r\nor within the diligent attention and observation of, the parties. An agent is not obligated to reveal to either party any confidential\r\ninformation obtained from the other party that does not involve the affirmative duties set forth above. BUYER'S AGENT\r\nA Buyer's agent can, with a Buyer's consent, agree to act as agent for the Buyer only. In these situations, the agent is not the Seller's\r\nagent, even if by agreement the agent may receive compensation for services rendered, either in full or in part from the Seller. An agent\r\nacting only for a Buyer has the following affirmative obligations:\r\nTo the Buyer: A fiduciary duty of utmost care, integrity, honesty and loyalty in dealings with the Buyer. To the Buyer and the Seller:\r\n(a) Diligent exercise of reasonable skill and care in performance of the agent's duties. (b) A duty of honest and fair dealing and good faith. (c) A duty to disclose all facts known to the agent materially affecting the value or desirability of the property that are not known to,\r\nor within the diligent attention and observation of, the parties.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT"},"c7aebc4b-445a-4ef3-a1d3-6abba4354f56":{"id_":"c7aebc4b-445a-4ef3-a1d3-6abba4354f56","metadata":{},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"MTOp26RubHOxlZhXR6GfmMmW+2JvY02j6dLRt9/lHTo=","metadata":{},"hash":"cZGUburwoiNVnDm8qGNe7D/Jqwv85KeTvjumadFdrWI="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"4a644c47-1e77-47e4-ae94-e3a989b5cd32","metadata":{},"hash":"6BP9PHS5hOZ0yHS4xWPlrmyAwx3C3FeHET9tNk7Zzlw="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"69f88d90-916a-48f2-939a-f96d360f3101","metadata":{},"hash":"ntt7jBooKN1iSl6KTZaJSYJrtuvCg/LsEq3ajJY0zRY="}},"hash":"pSvwTMm97ORlmFyDkKZggTtdzjLk1Xca5waOW7Iaeng=","text":"An agent is not obligated to reveal to either party any confidential\r\ninformation obtained from the other party that does not involve the affirmative duties set forth above. AGENT REPRESENTING BOTH SELLER AND BUYER\r\nA real estate agent, either acting directly or through one or more salespersons and broker associates, can legally be the agent of both\r\nthe Seller and the Buyer in a transaction, but only with the knowledge and consent of both the Seller and the Buyer. In a dual agency situation, the agent has the following affirmative obligations to both the Seller and the Buyer:\r\n(a) A fiduciary duty of utmost care, integrity, honesty and loyalty in the dealings with either the Seller or the Buyer. (b) Other duties to the Seller and the Buyer as stated above in their respective sections. In representing both Seller and Buyer, a dual agent may not, without the express permission of the respective party, disclose to the\r\nother party confidential information, including, but not limited to, facts relating to either the Buyer's or Seller's financial position,\r\nmotivations, bargaining position, or other personal information that may impact price, including the Seller's willingness to accept a price\r\nless than the listing price or the  Buyer's willingness to pay a price greater than the price offered. SELLER AND BUYER RESPONSIBILITIES\r\nEither the purchase agreement or a separate document will contain a confirmation of which agent is representing you and whether that\r\nagent is representing you exclusively in the transaction or acting as a dual agent. Please pay attention to that confirmation to make sure\r\nit accurately reflects your understanding of your agent's role. The above duties of the agent in a real estate transaction do not relieve a Seller or Buyer from the responsibility to protect his or her\r\nown interests. You should carefully read all agreements to assure that they adequately express your understanding of the transaction. A\r\nreal estate agent is a person qualified to advise about real estate. If legal or tax advice is desired, consult a competent professional. If you are a Buyer, you have the duty to exercise reasonable care to protect yourself, including as to those facts about the property\r\nwhich are known to you or within your diligent attention and observation. Both Sellers and Buyers should strongly consider obtaining tax advice from a competent professional because the federal and state tax\r\nconsequences of a transaction can be complex and subject to change.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT"},"69f88d90-916a-48f2-939a-f96d360f3101":{"id_":"69f88d90-916a-48f2-939a-f96d360f3101","metadata":{},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"MTOp26RubHOxlZhXR6GfmMmW+2JvY02j6dLRt9/lHTo=","metadata":{},"hash":"cZGUburwoiNVnDm8qGNe7D/Jqwv85KeTvjumadFdrWI="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"c7aebc4b-445a-4ef3-a1d3-6abba4354f56","metadata":{},"hash":"pSvwTMm97ORlmFyDkKZggTtdzjLk1Xca5waOW7Iaeng="}},"hash":"ntt7jBooKN1iSl6KTZaJSYJrtuvCg/LsEq3ajJY0zRY=","text":"Throughout your real property transaction you may receive more than one disclosure form, depending upon the number of agents\r\nassisting in the transaction.

Form WFA, Revised 12/21)\r\nProperty Address: (“Property”). WIREFRAUDANDELECTRONICFUNDSTRANSFERSADVISORY:\r\nThe ability to communicate and conduct business electronically is a convenience and reality in nearly all parts of our lives. At the same time, it has provided hackers and scammers new opportunities for their criminal activity. Many businesses\r\nhave been victimized and the real estate business is no exception. While wiring or electronically transferring funds is a welcome convenience, we all need to exercise extreme caution. Emails attempting to induce fraudulent wire transfers have been received and have appeared to be legitimate. Reports\r\nindicate that some hackers have been able to intercept emailed transfer instructions, obtain account information and, by\r\naltering some of the data, redirect the funds to a different account. It also appears that some hackers were able to provide\r\nfalse phone numbers for verifying the wiring or funds transfer instructions. In those cases, the victim called the number\r\nprovided to confirm the instructions, and then unwittingly authorized a transfer to somewhere or someone other than the\r\nintended recipient. ACCORDINGLY, YOU ARE ADVISED:\r\n1. Obtain phone numbers and account numbers only from Escrow Officers, Property Managers, or\r\nLandlords at the beginning of the transaction. 2. DO NOT EVER WIRE OR ELECTRONICALLY TRANSFER FUNDS PRIOR TO CALLING TO\r\nCONFIRM THE TRANSFER INSTRUCTIONS. ONLY USE A PHONE NUMBER YOU WERE\r\nPROVIDED PREVIOUSLY. Do not use any different phone number or account number included\r\nin any emailed transfer instructions. 3. Orally confirm the transfer instruction is legitimate and confirm the bank routing number,\r\naccount numbers and other codes before taking steps to transfer the funds. 4. Avoid sending personal information in emails or texts. Provide such information in person or\r\nover the telephone directly to the Escrow Officer, Property Manager, or Landlord. 5. Take steps to secure the system you are using with your email account. These steps include\r\ncreating strong passwords, using secure WiFi, and not using free services. If you believe you have received questionable or suspicious wire or funds transfer instructions, immediately notify your\r\nbank, and the other party, and the Escrow Office, Landlord, or Property Manager.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT"},"29b9f8d6-883f-42a9-8eba-ea05e929f465":{"id_":"29b9f8d6-883f-42a9-8eba-ea05e929f465","metadata":{},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"AhXnKJFxqUUvd+lSi8/jDCtfWtjilpgvYs6UfKH9kr4=","metadata":{},"hash":"L+sNCiuBaArbh5iEgcuYI2KAsPOuqz5pROJ7wKBBDuk="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"4ace1dba-e54a-4c71-b7f7-cf2745f65d69","metadata":{},"hash":"wqzoLTO2NNYswVBEGIJ1hTF+xZrC5kJ9/Rngg/v68rU="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"2ab443e7-c1e3-4787-b51f-dd20705eb0b6","metadata":{},"hash":"SEMgL0xgNMyCRhpR1Be0Glm8u7+Ww3+et+UEu6egNNA="}},"hash":"5PSThqk/c/fG8iZAewTU89sfgpKSroW5aXDsHtGySuY=","text":"The sources below, as well as others,\r\ncan also provide information:\r\nFederal Bureau of Investigation: https://www.fbi.gov/; the FBI's IC3 at www.ic3.gov; or 310-477-6565\r\nNational White Collar Crime Center: http://www.nw3c.org/\r\nOn Guard Online: https://www.onguardonline.gov/\r\nNOTE: There are existing alternatives to electronic and wired fund transfers such as cashier's checks.

Form BHIA, 12/23)\r\n1. IMPORTANCE OF OBTAINING PROPERTY INSURANCE:If the property you are purchasing is destroyed or damaged\r\ndue to natural disaster or accident or some other event, insurance may be available to help with the cost of repair or\r\nrebuilding. In the absence of property insurance, the homeowner would be responsible for the full expense. If the property\r\nis purchased with a loan, or refinanced, the lender will require an insurance policy protecting its interest. Insurance\r\npolicies can cover damage due to one or more of the following: fire, flood, earthquake and other causes. The policy or\r\nan insurance broker should be consulted to determine when coverage applies and whether a supplement or rider can be\r\npurchased to provide additional coverage or if a separate policy is necessary. 2. PROPERTY INSURANCE AND PURCHASE CONTRACT TERMS:Your real estate purchase contract may contain a\r\ncontingency that gives you the right to legally cancel the agreement within a specified time if you are unable to obtain or\r\nafford property insurance. This cancellation right may be part of an overall investigation contingency or may be a specific\r\ncontingency pertaining to insurance. If buyer waives or removes the applicable contingency before determining the\r\navailability and cost of property insurance, buyer is acting against the advice of broker. 3. CALIFORNIA'S PROPERTY INSURANCE MARKET:Some insurance carriers in California have stopped issuing new\r\nproperty insurance policies and others are limiting the number and location of new policies. These changes may affect\r\nboth the availability and cost of insurance. However, over 50 insurance carriers are admitted to sell property insurance in\r\nCalifornia so it may be possible to obtain insurance even if some carriers will not write a new policy covering the property\r\nyou intend to buy. An insurance broker may also be able to find a non-admitted insurance carrier offering to insure\r\nthe property you intend to buy. Because locating an affordable insurance policy could take time and effort, buyers are\r\nadvised to make all insurance inquiries as early in the home buying process as possible. 4. INSURANCE CONDITIONS:Many insurance carriers impose physical condition standards before issuing a policy, or\r\nreserve the right to cancel policies even after they are issued, if certain minimum standards are not confirmed in an\r\ninspection or otherwise.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT"},"97ca0a40-e228-4dd4-b8e0-9f48295ee25e":{"id_":"97ca0a40-e228-4dd4-b8e0-9f48295ee25e","metadata":{},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"fMMGbCOXr7mnepE55pjncwkpaRsUuRrJacOrZFLw0PA=","metadata":{},"hash":"ml054zV+yDiIgByV1xdo8P1IH/98VONMYoaVYx/D3hk="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"961cceec-50f7-4fc4-bdd3-a12a0f9fac1d","metadata":{},"hash":"4EZzztFdHTKZYWtNMoAtRQ5FsaL4rEg/5JZZ/vyt1RU="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"6691c2d3-ac3b-44ee-ad22-ab1ea1c6875d","metadata":{},"hash":"ngeI1VE/5hJHA13ag+0hKt03p9hPAviRl8RWE0NVgQk="}},"hash":"HVpOOVyXb2WscfkS44rU5jQwp0ovTUhAhtf9m4Hd254=","text":"Physical conditions standards could include, but are not limited to, prohibition of “knob and tube”\r\nelectrical wiring, requirements related to piping/plumbing materials, standards related to the age and/or quality of the roof\r\nor foundation, minimal safety standards related to handrails, tripping hazards, and defensible space requirements. 5.

Form CCPA, Revised 12/22)\r\nThe California Consumer Privacy Act (commencing with Civil Code § 1798.100) (“CCPA”), as amended by California voters\r\nin 2020, grants to California residents certain rights in their private, personal information (“PI”) that is collected by companies\r\nwith whom they do business. Under the CCPA, PI is defined broadly to encompass non-public records information that could\r\nreasonably be linked directly or indirectly to you. PI could potentially include photographs of, or sales information about, your\r\nproperty. During the process of buying and selling real estate your PI will be collected and likely shared with others, including real\r\nestate licensees, a Multiple Listing Service, real estate internet websites, service providers, lenders, and title and escrow\r\ncompanies, to name several possibilities. Businesses that are covered by the CCPA are required to grant you various rights\r\nin your PI, including the right to know what PI is collected, the right to know what PI is sold or shared and to whom, the right\r\nto request that the business correct or delete your PI, the right to “opt out” or stop the transfer of your PI to others, and the\r\nright to limit the use of certain PI which is considered “sensitive. ” You may get one or more notices regarding your CCPA\r\nrights from businesses you interact with in a real estate transaction. However, not all businesses that receive or share your\r\nPI are obligated to comply with the CCPA. Moreover, businesses that are otherwise covered under the CCPA may have a\r\nlegal obligation to maintain PI, notwithstanding your instruction to the contrary. For instance, regardless of whether they are\r\ncovered by CCPA, under California law, brokers and Multiple Listing Services are required to maintain their records for 3\r\nyears. If you wish to exercise your rights under CCPA, where applicable, you should contact the respective business directly. You can obtain more information about the CCPA and your rights under the law from the State of California Department\r\nof Justice (oag.ca.gov/privacy/ccpa). Additionally, the California Privacy Protection Agency is authorized to promulgate\r\nregulations which may further clarify requirements of the CCPA (cppa.ca.gov/regulations/).","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT"},"e245bf56-29c5-430c-95b1-3c7507184545":{"id_":"e245bf56-29c5-430c-95b1-3c7507184545","metadata":{},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"69yYc4g1QkGLhORCLSw4RrlJwcEG/qyq7BXhMjvj+sM=","metadata":{},"hash":"s1QoNlzkIM5L7jQLrl7Th/+ctKNYmjGJxdzYRVCSWCw="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"c78a1114-3e70-49bb-97ab-ff82e42a283d","metadata":{},"hash":"EwGoIxX/jqD6dx+RcEdmZD/nMadW1NEgsNLplRjUkTg="}},"hash":"vxDWhsVGThZimsR1U6JhvDOMU8wD8yiJjGDwuA8GDcQ=","text":"I/we acknowledge receipt of a copy of this California Consumer Privacy Act Advisory, Disclosure and Notice.

When you enter into a discussion with a real estate agent regarding a real estate transaction, you should from the outset understand\r\nwhat type of agency relationship or representation you wish to have with the agent in the transaction. SELLER'S AGENT\r\nA Seller's agent under a listing agreement with the Seller acts as the agent for the Seller only. A Seller's agent or a subagent of that\r\nagent has the following affirmative obligations:\r\nTo the Seller: A Fiduciary duty of utmost care, integrity, honesty and loyalty in dealings with the Seller. To the Buyer and the Seller:\r\n(a) Diligent exercise of reasonable skill and care in performance of the agent's duties. (b) A duty of honest and fair dealing and good faith. (c) A duty to disclose all facts known to the agent materially affecting the value or desirability of the property that are not known to,\r\nor within the diligent attention and observation of, the parties. An agent is not obligated to reveal to either party any confidential\r\ninformation obtained from the other party that does not involve the affirmative duties set forth above. BUYER'S AGENT\r\nA Buyer's agent can, with a Buyer's consent, agree to act as agent for the Buyer only. In these situations, the agent is not the Seller's\r\nagent, even if by agreement the agent may receive compensation for services rendered, either in full or in part from the Seller. An agent\r\nacting only for a Buyer has the following affirmative obligations:\r\nTo the Buyer: A fiduciary duty of utmost care, integrity, honesty and loyalty in dealings with the Buyer. To the Buyer and the Seller:\r\n(a) Diligent exercise of reasonable skill and care in performance of the agent's duties. (b) A duty of honest and fair dealing and good faith.

In a dual agency situation, the agent has the following affirmative obligations to both the Seller and the Buyer:\r\n(a) A fiduciary duty of utmost care, integrity, honesty and loyalty in the dealings with either the Seller or the Buyer. (b) Other duties to the Seller and the Buyer as stated above in their respective sections. In representing both Seller and Buyer, a dual agent may not, without the express permission of the respective party, disclose to the\r\nother party confidential information, including, but not limited to, facts relating to either the Buyer's or Seller's financial position,\r\nmotivations, bargaining position, or other personal information that may impact price, including the Seller's willingness to accept a price\r\nless than the listing price or the  Buyer's willingness to pay a price greater than the price offered. SELLER AND BUYER RESPONSIBILITIES\r\nEither the purchase agreement or a separate document will contain a confirmation of which agent is representing you and whether that\r\nagent is representing you exclusively in the transaction or acting as a dual agent. Please pay attention to that confirmation to make sure\r\nit accurately reflects your understanding of your agent's role. The above duties of the agent in a real estate transaction do not relieve a Seller or Buyer from the responsibility to protect his or her\r\nown interests. You should carefully read all agreements to assure that they adequately express your understanding of the transaction. A\r\nreal estate agent is a person qualified to advise about real estate. If legal or tax advice is desired, consult a competent professional. If you are a Buyer, you have the duty to exercise reasonable care to protect yourself, including as to those facts about the property\r\nwhich are known to you or within your diligent attention and observation. Both Sellers and Buyers should strongly consider obtaining tax advice from a competent professional because the federal and state tax\r\nconsequences of a transaction can be complex and subject to change.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT"},"e439d175-fe24-4530-a394-fa1b1ccc3b91":{"id_":"e439d175-fe24-4530-a394-fa1b1ccc3b91","metadata":{},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"3+TvsOG4vCW+PdSPvY/asJK6qcqWmX3QSr8AL2VVkqg=","metadata":{},"hash":"8ZSELAjvjRlWTs4aLZ3CW65EXe+PdDRoxKAVe167hqA="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"ab9de8a6-e4a8-42de-a116-e6eb0442a7d2","metadata":{},"hash":"pSvwTMm97ORlmFyDkKZggTtdzjLk1Xca5waOW7Iaeng="}},"hash":"e+9I6LWCKPYN+MXwIeq9zl1eZhIVESXVhcHowRwGdQM=","text":"Throughout your real property transaction you may receive more than one disclosure form, depending upon the number of agents\r\nassisting in the transaction.

Form WFA, Revised 12/21)\r\nProperty Address: (“Property”). WIREFRAUDANDELECTRONICFUNDSTRANSFERSADVISORY:\r\nThe ability to communicate and conduct business electronically is a convenience and reality in nearly all parts of our lives. At the same time, it has provided hackers and scammers new opportunities for their criminal activity. Many businesses\r\nhave been victimized and the real estate business is no exception. While wiring or electronically transferring funds is a welcome convenience, we all need to exercise extreme caution. Emails attempting to induce fraudulent wire transfers have been received and have appeared to be legitimate. Reports\r\nindicate that some hackers have been able to intercept emailed transfer instructions, obtain account information and, by\r\naltering some of the data, redirect the funds to a different account. It also appears that some hackers were able to provide\r\nfalse phone numbers for verifying the wiring or funds transfer instructions. In those cases, the victim called the number\r\nprovided to confirm the instructions, and then unwittingly authorized a transfer to somewhere or someone other than the\r\nintended recipient. ACCORDINGLY, YOU ARE ADVISED:\r\n1. Obtain phone numbers and account numbers only from Escrow Officers, Property Managers, or\r\nLandlords at the beginning of the transaction. 2. DO NOT EVER WIRE OR ELECTRONICALLY TRANSFER FUNDS PRIOR TO CALLING TO\r\nCONFIRM THE TRANSFER INSTRUCTIONS. ONLY USE A PHONE NUMBER YOU WERE\r\nPROVIDED PREVIOUSLY. Do not use any different phone number or account number included\r\nin any emailed transfer instructions. 3. Orally confirm the transfer instruction is legitimate and confirm the bank routing number,\r\naccount numbers and other codes before taking steps to transfer the funds. 4. Avoid sending personal information in emails or texts. Provide such information in person or\r\nover the telephone directly to the Escrow Officer, Property Manager, or Landlord. 5. Take steps to secure the system you are using with your email account. These steps include\r\ncreating strong passwords, using secure WiFi, and not using free services. If you believe you have received questionable or suspicious wire or funds transfer instructions, immediately notify your\r\nbank, and the other party, and the Escrow Office, Landlord, or Property Manager.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT"},"05199650-436d-48d3-9988-c2e378581593":{"id_":"05199650-436d-48d3-9988-c2e378581593","metadata":{},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"6ZB0Na9sF9W+sxtHbxc6CdPc7TRDq0L2fa344IYW3+A=","metadata":{},"hash":"gkam3XPVAWbFNz3S/ZAhzvAkIn7OZrKz+a0xsYk0984="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"b41f8406-a955-4849-ab2d-798409ed8ec8","metadata":{},"hash":"wqzoLTO2NNYswVBEGIJ1hTF+xZrC5kJ9/Rngg/v68rU="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"9d84d09b-c8da-4370-a1c0-a2b4395f7dfb","metadata":{},"hash":"ZWePLWbbf0UVxsPlexNHYcRoPvhsfZMoSxs17/j3ymw="}},"hash":"5PSThqk/c/fG8iZAewTU89sfgpKSroW5aXDsHtGySuY=","text":"The sources below, as well as others,\r\ncan also provide information:\r\nFederal Bureau of Investigation: https://www.fbi.gov/; the FBI's IC3 at www.ic3.gov; or 310-477-6565\r\nNational White Collar Crime Center: http://www.nw3c.org/\r\nOn Guard Online: https://www.onguardonline.gov/\r\nNOTE: There are existing alternatives to electronic and wired fund transfers such as cashier's checks.

Form SA, Revised 6/23)\r\n1. INTRODUCTION:Selling property in California is a process that involves many steps. From start to finish, it could take anywhere\r\nfrom a few weeks to many months, depending upon the condition of your Property, local market conditions and other factors. You\r\nhave already taken an important first step by listing your Property for sale with a licensed real estate broker. Your broker will help\r\nguide you through the process and may refer you to other professionals, as needed. This advisory addresses many things you may\r\nneed to think about and do as you market your Property. Some of these things are requirements imposed upon you, either by law or\r\nby the listing or sale contract. Others are simply practical matters that may arise during the process. Please read this document\r\ncarefully and, if you have any questions, ask your broker or appropriate legal or tax advisor for help. 2. DISCLOSURES:\r\nA. GeneralDisclosureDuties:You must affirmatively disclose to the buyer, in writing, all known facts that materially affect the value\r\nor desirability of your Property. You must disclose these facts whether or not asked about such matters by the buyer, any broker,\r\nor anyone else. This duty to disclose applies even if the buyer agrees to purchase your Property in its present condition without\r\nrequiring you to make any repairs. If you do not know what or how to disclose, you should consult a real estate attorney in\r\nCalifornia of your choosing. Broker cannot advise you on the legal sufficiency of any disclosures you make. If the Property you are\r\nselling is a residence with one to four units except for certain subdivisions, your broker also has a duty to conduct a reasonably\r\ncompetent and diligent visual inspection of the accessible areas and to disclose to a buyer all adverse material facts that the\r\ninspection reveals. If your broker discovers something that could indicate a problem, your broker must advise the buyer. B. Statutory Duties(For one-to-four Residential Units):\r\n(1)You must timely prepare and deliver to the buyer, among other things, a Real Estate Transfer Disclosure Statement (“TDS”),\r\nand a Natural Hazard Disclosure Statement (“NHD”).

If your property is in a high\r\nor very high fire zone, and you have to complete the TDS, you will also be responsible for disclosing compliance with\r\ndefensible space laws and, depending on the Property's age, may also have to disclose if the building itself has been\r\nhardened to protect it from catching fire.

This is true even if the buyer gets their own inspections covering the same area. Obtaining inspection reports may also assist you during contract negotiations with the buyer. For example, if a Structural Pest\r\nControl Report has both a primary and secondary recommendation for clearance, you may want to specify in the purchase\r\nagreement those recommendations, if any, for which you are going to pay. B. Post-Sale Protections:It is often helpful to provide the buyer with, among other things, a home protection/warranty plan for\r\nthe Property. These plans will generally cover problems, not deemed to be pre-existing, that occur after your sale is\r\ncompleted. In the event something does go wrong after the sale, and it is covered by the plan, the buyer may be able to\r\nresolve the concern by contacting the home protection company. C.

Form CCPA, Revised 12/22)\r\nThe California Consumer Privacy Act (commencing with Civil Code § 1798.100) (“CCPA”), as amended by California voters\r\nin 2020, grants to California residents certain rights in their private, personal information (“PI”) that is collected by companies\r\nwith whom they do business. Under the CCPA, PI is defined broadly to encompass non-public records information that could\r\nreasonably be linked directly or indirectly to you. PI could potentially include photographs of, or sales information about, your\r\nproperty. During the process of buying and selling real estate your PI will be collected and likely shared with others, including real\r\nestate licensees, a Multiple Listing Service, real estate internet websites, service providers, lenders, and title and escrow\r\ncompanies, to name several possibilities. Businesses that are covered by the CCPA are required to grant you various rights\r\nin your PI, including the right to know what PI is collected, the right to know what PI is sold or shared and to whom, the right\r\nto request that the business correct or delete your PI, the right to “opt out” or stop the transfer of your PI to others, and the\r\nright to limit the use of certain PI which is considered “sensitive. ” You may get one or more notices regarding your CCPA\r\nrights from businesses you interact with in a real estate transaction. However, not all businesses that receive or share your\r\nPI are obligated to comply with the CCPA. Moreover, businesses that are otherwise covered under the CCPA may have a\r\nlegal obligation to maintain PI, notwithstanding your instruction to the contrary. For instance, regardless of whether they are\r\ncovered by CCPA, under California law, brokers and Multiple Listing Services are required to maintain their records for 3\r\nyears. If you wish to exercise your rights under CCPA, where applicable, you should contact the respective business directly. You can obtain more information about the CCPA and your rights under the law from the State of California Department\r\nof Justice (oag.ca.gov/privacy/ccpa). Additionally, the California Privacy Protection Agency is authorized to promulgate\r\nregulations which may further clarify requirements of the CCPA (cppa.ca.gov/regulations/).","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT"},"a532541b-958b-4ff4-87af-9c26e1ffa55f":{"id_":"a532541b-958b-4ff4-87af-9c26e1ffa55f","metadata":{},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"i6pic4xxCkjj8b92qtUyZUOM2ozKa74npMl+96aDMxQ=","metadata":{},"hash":"j6t+yOh+HeIb8Eor0fYdRgrxlpxSK/5/fR9BnDbu09I="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"8d2f0f12-89f9-4e8d-9953-bf1ac3a18088","metadata":{},"hash":"EwGoIxX/jqD6dx+RcEdmZD/nMadW1NEgsNLplRjUkTg="}},"hash":"0/zY/W8Nh6oirP6S7UIxvot1SF2x1gRIQdYudK0Szdc=","text":"I/we acknowledge receipt of a copy of this California Consumer Privacy Act Advisory, Disclosure and Notice.

This Property is a duplex, triplex, or fourplex. An AVID is required for all units. This AVID form is for all units (or   only\r\nunit(s)       ).

The duty applies regardless of whom that Agent represents. The duty applies to\r\nresidential real properties containing one-to-four dwelling units, and manufactured homes (mobilehomes). The duty applies\r\nto a stand-alone detached dwelling (whether or not located in asubdivision or a planned development) or to an attached\r\ndwelling such as a condominium. The duty also applies to a lease with an option to purchase, a ground lease or a real\r\nproperty sales contract of one of those properties. California law does not requirethe Agent to inspect the following:\r\n●Areas that are not reasonably and normally accessible\r\n●Areas off site of the property\r\n●Public records or permits\r\n●Common areas of planned developments, condominiums, stock cooperatives and the like. Agent Inspection Limitations: Because the Agent's duty is limited to conducting a reasonably competent and diligent visual\r\ninspection of reasonably and normally accessible areas of only the Property being offered for sale, there are several things that\r\nthe Agent will not do. What follows is a non-exclusive list of examples of limitations on the scope of the Agent's duty. RoofandAttic:Agent will not climb onto a roof or into an attic. Interior:Agent will not move or look under or behind furniture, pictures, wall hangings or floor coverings.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT"},"fdfe1759-f12a-4be5-b772-cb4c4e8af8a8":{"id_":"fdfe1759-f12a-4be5-b772-cb4c4e8af8a8","metadata":{},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"gvDy7/+9G2Tf7rBk75SdiXIu973aLgai8p4FwG0VAB0=","metadata":{},"hash":"kbfAEQJxu1iYM3y5Q2p1SDJ1eF+mCY0v0LWlVanSodU="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"57b198ab-a2b5-44b1-a32c-661b6cbec30b","metadata":{},"hash":"BZSQhUw6TZEiuFu6NU3LVO+sREm41K+aSsr/b1L9kgs="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"a30ca1d8-4ac5-4fdf-bca1-a76c6c8d69d5","metadata":{},"hash":"vT289FbjhjDmQHy7CeE6f+uw6XJPjs7JEYag7Q8a36c="}},"hash":"s2xseEcW7T4rDSNnUVuFFWoe7q5bIX/qwZ/4/AJR8GY=","text":"Agent will not\r\nlook up chimneys or into cabinets, or open locked doors.

Form WFA, Revised 12/21)\r\nProperty Address: (“Property”). WIREFRAUDANDELECTRONICFUNDSTRANSFERSADVISORY:\r\nThe ability to communicate and conduct business electronically is a convenience and reality in nearly all parts of our lives. At the same time, it has provided hackers and scammers new opportunities for their criminal activity. Many businesses\r\nhave been victimized and the real estate business is no exception. While wiring or electronically transferring funds is a welcome convenience, we all need to exercise extreme caution. Emails attempting to induce fraudulent wire transfers have been received and have appeared to be legitimate. Reports\r\nindicate that some hackers have been able to intercept emailed transfer instructions, obtain account information and, by\r\naltering some of the data, redirect the funds to a different account. It also appears that some hackers were able to provide\r\nfalse phone numbers for verifying the wiring or funds transfer instructions. In those cases, the victim called the number\r\nprovided to confirm the instructions, and then unwittingly authorized a transfer to somewhere or someone other than the\r\nintended recipient. ACCORDINGLY, YOU ARE ADVISED:\r\n1. Obtain phone numbers and account numbers only from Escrow Officers, Property Managers, or\r\nLandlords at the beginning of the transaction. 2. DO NOT EVER WIRE OR ELECTRONICALLY TRANSFER FUNDS PRIOR TO CALLING TO\r\nCONFIRM THE TRANSFER INSTRUCTIONS. ONLY USE A PHONE NUMBER YOU WERE\r\nPROVIDED PREVIOUSLY. Do not use any different phone number or account number included\r\nin any emailed transfer instructions. 3. Orally confirm the transfer instruction is legitimate and confirm the bank routing number,\r\naccount numbers and other codes before taking steps to transfer the funds. 4. Avoid sending personal information in emails or texts. Provide such information in person or\r\nover the telephone directly to the Escrow Officer, Property Manager, or Landlord. 5. Take steps to secure the system you are using with your email account. These steps include\r\ncreating strong passwords, using secure WiFi, and not using free services. If you believe you have received questionable or suspicious wire or funds transfer instructions, immediately notify your\r\nbank, and the other party, and the Escrow Office, Landlord, or Property Manager.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT"},"39fbfeb3-968f-4f31-ab18-e7a0e130ccb2":{"id_":"39fbfeb3-968f-4f31-ab18-e7a0e130ccb2","metadata":{},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"T3f0eB6jEepH5PGWqV1XhcRHpOKJGrqwc5TF4oAufiI=","metadata":{},"hash":"W+th+9l232xXae+KNErGLa78Ae5cjuXWrN4UlWH5bAk="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"c521975d-da2f-4ae9-970a-3553cbc8389d","metadata":{},"hash":"wqzoLTO2NNYswVBEGIJ1hTF+xZrC5kJ9/Rngg/v68rU="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"b08cd5ec-24e8-4d0b-9906-6f68a5a18708","metadata":{},"hash":"hFkP5Lv942UC46iY6KP3onCHRW3AGFu5g2Zfu7Hkt4s="}},"hash":"5PSThqk/c/fG8iZAewTU89sfgpKSroW5aXDsHtGySuY=","text":"The sources below, as well as others,\r\ncan also provide information:\r\nFederal Bureau of Investigation: https://www.fbi.gov/; the FBI's IC3 at www.ic3.gov; or 310-477-6565\r\nNational White Collar Crime Center: http://www.nw3c.org/\r\nOn Guard Online: https://www.onguardonline.gov/\r\nNOTE: There are existing alternatives to electronic and wired fund transfers such as cashier's checks.

The following information is intended to explain the warning furnished by Seller of this home for exposures to formaldehyde, a\r\nsubstance known to the State of California to cause cancer. The exposures are caused by materials of which the house is or\r\nwill be built. The United States Environmental Protection Agency, the California Air Resources Board, and other agencies have measured\r\nthe presence of formaldehyde in the indoor air of homes in California. Levels of formaldehyde that present a significant cancer\r\nrisk have been measured in most homes. Formaldehyde is present in the air because it is emitted by a variety of building\r\nmaterials and home products purchased by Seller from materials suppliers. These materials include carpeting, pressed wood\r\nproducts, insulation, plastics, and glues. This home, if constructed prior to entering into this Agreement, has not been tested, and if constructed after entering into this\r\nAgreement, will not be tested. Most homes that have been tested elsewhere do contain formaldehyde, although the concentrations\r\nvary from home to home with no obvious explanation for the differences. One of the problems is that many suppliers of building\r\nmaterials and home products do not provide information on chemical ingredients to builders. In the absence of specific information on\r\nthese homes, and in light of the materials used in their construction, Seller believes that a warning is necessary. Buyer may have further questions about these issues. Seller is willing to share any further information Seller has obtained and\r\nwill provide, upon request, a list of known materials suppliers that may be contacted for further information, and whether any\r\ninquiry has been made by Seller.

IMPORTANCE OF PROPERTY INVESTIGATION:The physical condition of the land and improvements being\r\npurchased is not guaranteed by either Seller or Brokers. You have an affirmative duty to exercise reasonable care to\r\nprotect yourself, including discovery of the legal, practical and technical implications of disclosed facts, and the\r\ninvestigation and verification of information and facts that you know or that are within your diligent attention and\r\nobservation. A general physical inspection typically does not cover all aspects of the Property nor items affecting the\r\nProperty that are not physically located on the Property. If the professionals recommend further investigations,\r\nincluding a recommendation by a pest control operator to inspect inaccessible areas of the Property, you should\r\ncontact qualified experts to conduct such additional investigations. 2.

INFORMATION ABOUT BED BUGS:\r\n1. Bed Bug Appearance:Bed bugs have six legs. Adult bed bugs have flat bodies about 1/4 of an inch in length. Their color can vary\r\nfrom red and brown to copper colored. Young bed bugs are very small. Their bodies are about 1/16 of an inch in length. They have\r\nalmost no color. When a bed bug feeds, its body swells, may lengthen, and becomes bright red, sometimes making it appear to be\r\na different insect. Bed bugs do not fly. They can either crawl or be carried from place to place on objects, people, or animals. Bed\r\nbugs can be hard to find and identify because they are tiny and try to stay hidden. 2. Life Cycle and Reproduction:An average bed bug lives for about 10 months. Female bed bugs lay one to five eggs per day. Bed\r\nbugs grow to full adulthood in about 21 days. 3.Bed bugs can survive for months without feeding. 4. Bed Bug Bites:Because bed bugs usually feed at night, most people are bitten in their sleep and do not realize they were bitten. A person's reaction to insect bites is an immune response and so varies from person to person. Sometimes the red welts caused\r\nby the bites will not be noticed until many days after a person was bitten, if at all. 5. Common signs and symptoms of a possible bed bug infestation:\r\n●Small red to reddish brown fecal spots on mattresses, box springs, bed frames, mattresses, linens, upholstery, or walls. ●Molted bed bug skins, white, sticky eggs, or empty eggshells. ●Very heavily infested areas may have a characteristically sweet odor. ●Red, itchy bite marks, especially on the legs, arms, and other body parts exposed while sleeping.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT"},"215e848b-bab6-4b52-8186-b584fb8fcc82":{"id_":"215e848b-bab6-4b52-8186-b584fb8fcc82","metadata":{},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"xRnUQi0MG5veAHpMM2hvwYzH6naIipQmV9f2QHofRa4=","metadata":{},"hash":"TpUh1iST95lF40iCMrjB8brIhTPa9ktkVYeLWuLYmJE="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"9ffc892f-4963-41a6-845d-439bbc6ffd5d","metadata":{},"hash":"/wFl/GHea7Pi3EhbDBb/pMkP+2t4ECA0gJiNie8uNJU="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"f2d772f4-0d96-4239-a984-8bc8dea0dd34","metadata":{},"hash":"01jdRLmaV/XeV6p0crmursL5PeEnanmh1M5lkcI6bcQ="}},"hash":"ZVAliMwev1J2Pr1ACIBGGBL2W0poLlm5uZiJZ1hqakU=","text":"However, some people do\r\nnot show bed bug lesions on their bodies even though bed bugs may have fed on them. 6.For more information, see the Internet Web sites of the United States Environmental Protection Agency and the National Pest\r\nManagement Association. 7.

Form BHAA, 6/23)\r\nCalifornia Civil Code section 4525 requires sellers of condominiums and other common interest or planned unit developments\r\n(“CID”) to provide buyers with governing, financial, and other documents and information created and maintained by a\r\nHomeowners Association (“HOA”). These documents may be quite lengthy, causing buyers not to take the time to make a\r\ncareful review of all HOA materials. Before deciding to proceed with the purchase transaction, it is critical that buyers carefully\r\nreview all HOA documents to determine for themselves if the property they are acquiring meetings their current and future\r\nneeds for use and enjoyment of the property. As part of this review, Buyer should also consider if any of the documentation\r\nhas not been provided, is incomplete, or missing. BUYER:\r\nYOU ARE STRONGLY ADVISED BY YOUR BROKER TO REVIEW ALL HOMEOWNER ASSOCIATION DOCUMENTS\r\nWITH APPROPRIATE PROFESSIONALS, IF NECESSARY, TO UNDERSTAND THEIR CONTENTS. YOU ARE\r\nFURTHER ADVISED TO CAREFULLY REVIEW THE PRELIMINARY TITLE REPORT TO DETERMINE ALL THE\r\nRECORDED DOCUMENTS RELATED TO HOMEOWNERS ASSOCIATIONS, WHICH COULD INCLUDE, BUT ARE NOT\r\nLIMITED TO, DEED RESTRICTIONS AND THE EXISTENCE OF MULTIPLE HOAs AFFECTING THE PROPERTY. THESE DOCUMENTS WILL GOVERN, AFFECT AND, IN SOME CASES, LIMIT YOUR CURRENT AND FUTURE USE\r\nAND ENJOYMENT OF THE PROPERTY. All HOA documents and disclosures are important, however, the following are often areas of concern for buyers of\r\nproperty located in a CID. 1. Covenants, Conditions, and Restrictions (“CC&Rs”): The CC&Rs are the main governing document of the HOA. Generally, the CC&Rs describe the property rights, duties, and obligations of the HOA and the individual members. CC&Rs are formal documents recorded with the County Recorder and are extremely difficult to amend or change. 2. Bylaws, Rules and Regulations:Bylaws address the governance and operation of the HOA, including voting and\r\nelection requirements, the number of directors and their term length, how and when meetings are held, and the\r\nmeeting procedures.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT"},"a9e6c39d-94de-4d94-b8de-637ee5c3da11":{"id_":"a9e6c39d-94de-4d94-b8de-637ee5c3da11","metadata":{},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"SSQgv+FhV8giUyzQrCJhqUT27arqNv7fxrAx5FEaGHg=","metadata":{},"hash":"0ba/u7wKYbzhPMl0iZMpyV7GwVLoyBpyAJqnHIiF54U="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"67383e95-7eb3-447b-a293-8313db693eeb","metadata":{},"hash":"LkOmrdZ3GVDAsZci8H5ku7yV6OBJ/R518QvYZWrDsGc="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"51d42ce6-8aa4-446c-88c6-7df799cff7a9","metadata":{},"hash":"T8tnVY6tDrDeQhsZgMfyX8EX/j+AXF5dwCZMba2SUCE="}},"hash":"YdvoEkXevUutsCJnyZ2Oiy9KeBS9bAX8QEneCaghuVc=","text":"If promulgated by the HOA, the Rules and Regulations usually detail how the HOA will handle\r\nroutine, day-to-day matters often affecting common area usage, expenses, etc. 3. Minutes:HOAs are required to prepare Minutes of Board of Directors' Meetings detailing past, current, and future\r\n(proposed) events, issues, and expenses such as existing or planned litigation, repairs, improvements or needed\r\nchange in the dues and/or additional assessments. They reflect the decisions and reasons for those decisions, but are\r\nnot a transcript of the meetings. The Minutes are often the best source of information regarding issues related to the\r\ncommon areas, the individual units, special and increased assessments, and the ability to use and enjoy the property\r\nafter escrow closes. 4. Financial Information: The financial information from the HOA may be contained in numerous documents, including\r\nbut not limited to: Pro Forma Operating Budget, Assessment and Reserve Funding Disclosure Summary, Financial\r\nStatement Review, Assessment Enforcement Policy, Insurance Summary, Regular Assessment, Special Assessments,\r\nand Emergency Assessments. The financial status of HOA could impact the future costs of owning the property. Reserves:Buyers should determine if reserves are properly and adequately funded and if there are many\r\nhomeowners who are delinquent on payments for dues and assessments. Generally, associations are\r\nrequired to prepare a reserve study, and, at least every three years, cause to be conducted a reasonably\r\ncompetent and diligent visual inspection. Pending and Future Assessments:The Minutes and the HOA disclosure form itself may contain critical\r\ninformation and comments regarding pending or future assessment. Special or Emergency Assessments:Buyers need to know if special or emergency assessments are\r\ncurrently due in full or whether they are due only in monthly installments. If it is not clear, buyer should\r\nrequest clarification from the HOA. The Purchase Agreement will determine whether the assessment payment\r\nwill be paid by the seller at Close of Escrow, or whether the payments are prorated, and the buyer will be\r\nresponsible for the monthly payments after Close of Escrow. There are independent services available which will review the HOA documentation and give an opinion of the financial\r\nstatus of a HOA for a fee which is typically $300.00 to $500.00 depending upon the services to be provided and the extent\r\nof the HOA documentation.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT"},"51d42ce6-8aa4-446c-88c6-7df799cff7a9":{"id_":"51d42ce6-8aa4-446c-88c6-7df799cff7a9","metadata":{},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"SSQgv+FhV8giUyzQrCJhqUT27arqNv7fxrAx5FEaGHg=","metadata":{},"hash":"0ba/u7wKYbzhPMl0iZMpyV7GwVLoyBpyAJqnHIiF54U="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"a9e6c39d-94de-4d94-b8de-637ee5c3da11","metadata":{},"hash":"YdvoEkXevUutsCJnyZ2Oiy9KeBS9bAX8QEneCaghuVc="}},"hash":"T8tnVY6tDrDeQhsZgMfyX8EX/j+AXF5dwCZMba2SUCE=","text":"Real estate licensees are not qualified to assess the financial viability of any HOA.

These\r\nrestrictions may be based on the number/percentage of units that are allowed to be rented, and the approval process\r\nassociated with rentals. The HOA may also put restrictions on the ability to enter into a short term rental. Some HOAs\r\nhave even gone so far as to completely prohibit rentals for all new owners; however, a 2021 law requires HOAs to allow\r\nat least 25% of the units to be rented or leased regardless of what the HOA governing documents state. In addition to\r\nthe HOA restrictions, the city may also impose rental control and eviction control ordinances that may impact your\r\ndecisions to rent the unit. You should investigate these issues with the HOA and the appropriate government authority to\r\ndetermine whether this property meets your needs. These restrictions may affect your decision to purchase the Property. 6. Lending Considerations:Lenders may have certain qualifications that are required from the HOA before they provide\r\nfinancing on your purchase. Many lenders will require the HOA to provide a lender certification document, providing\r\ninformation regarding the HOA. They may require a certain percentage of owner occupied units within the HOA. Further,\r\nif you are seeking a FHA or VA loan, the lender may require the HOA to FHA/VA approved prior to making a loan. You\r\nshould inquire with your lender and the HOA to determine what will be required in order to obtain financing. 7. Noise:Due to noise and other factors, HOAs often restrict the type of floor and/or wall material that can be used in\r\ncertain units and/or the number of pets. You should directly contact the HOA Board to determine whether the property\r\ncan be used for your intended purposes. You should also determine whether the property meets your subjective\r\npersonal preferences and needs. 8.Common Areas:Those portions of a CID that are not wholly owned by the individual homeowners are designated as\r\n“Common Areas”. Usually, the CC&Rs and/or the Bylaws will define what constitutes the Common Areas, how they are\r\nused, who gets to use them, and who is responsible for maintenance. Some Common Areas may be available for use by\r\nall members and their guests, such as a lobby or garden.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT"},"75b0fcbf-e84c-44c9-a474-a4e8c6d8207e":{"id_":"75b0fcbf-e84c-44c9-a474-a4e8c6d8207e","metadata":{},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"nIAdOx7I0BjBUDevdWcwbV7nJ9iYEOgiFrjw/sAO+GA=","metadata":{},"hash":"fHGhbAbyPB1r+2xfMN5gpoqK6qC847430HNRQ2TbSC8="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"9b61aca1-c5be-437e-b5e6-d55a1c07905f","metadata":{},"hash":"WCJrFl5hJ3dt8VJnOt4snJLixRodzHUplvCzffutse8="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"3c6f7d0f-6aac-47fe-b1e9-41432a9fa1db","metadata":{},"hash":"lN0YrL4ofiuY5ECi/AuOLhKDmirjpGGEvSgDDIh4LRE="}},"hash":"YtovrpEcFN5GPr19u3oHLTy5snuynSe5oG9jMZ83nS0=","text":"However, some Common Areas may be “Restricted” or\r\n“Exclusive Use” Common Areas with access limited to certain homeowners (this is often true with swimming pools and\r\nspas especially when there are multiple HOAs within a CID), or may be restricted to just one homeowner, such as a roof,\r\ndeck, balcony, or patio. In some instances, the homeowner may be responsible for maintenance of certain Restricted or\r\nExclusive Use Common Areas. You should determine for yourself whether there are any restrictions affecting the\r\nCommon Areas which could impact your intended use and enjoyment of the property. 9. Parking and Storage:You should determine for yourself whether the allotted parking space(s) are adequate to park\r\nyour vehicle(s) in the assigned spaces by actually parking in those spaces. Parking space(s) and storage space(s), if\r\nany, may be described in a Condominium Map or in the Preliminary Report issued by a Title Company. The actual\r\nmarkings, striping and numbering of these space(s) may not accurately reflect the actual spaces and may be in\r\nconflict with the space(s) designated in the recorded documents. It is therefore crucial that you personally determine if\r\nthe parking and storage space(s) that are designated in the recorded documents are actually the space(s) being\r\ntransferred to you and that those space(s) are acceptable for your needs and intended uses of the property. 10. Litigation:Many CIDs have been involved in, or are presently involved in, or may become involved in, litigation regarding\r\nthe design, construction, maintenance and/or condition of all or a part of the Development. Whether or not these lawsuits\r\nare successful, litigation is expensive, and the cost of such legal actions may impact not only the adequacy of the HOA\r\nreserves but also the amount of current or future assessments. Such litigation may also impact the willingness of lenders\r\nto make a loan secured by the property, and buyer's ability to obtain a loan to purchase the property. 11. Special Needs:HOA documents may limit the number and size of animals allowed in units. Fair Housing Laws may impact\r\nthe effect of such rules on “service” and/or “companion” animals. HOAs on their own, or because of local ordinances,\r\nmay limit or completely ban smoking and/or vaping in common areas or units.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT"},"3c6f7d0f-6aac-47fe-b1e9-41432a9fa1db":{"id_":"3c6f7d0f-6aac-47fe-b1e9-41432a9fa1db","metadata":{},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"nIAdOx7I0BjBUDevdWcwbV7nJ9iYEOgiFrjw/sAO+GA=","metadata":{},"hash":"fHGhbAbyPB1r+2xfMN5gpoqK6qC847430HNRQ2TbSC8="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"75b0fcbf-e84c-44c9-a474-a4e8c6d8207e","metadata":{},"hash":"YtovrpEcFN5GPr19u3oHLTy5snuynSe5oG9jMZ83nS0="}},"hash":"lN0YrL4ofiuY5ECi/AuOLhKDmirjpGGEvSgDDIh4LRE=","text":"The ability for new buyers to rent units and/\r\nor to operate any type of business may also be limited or completely forbidden.

It does not alter the legal or contractual relationship between a buyer\r\nand seller. 1. IMPORTANCE OF PROPERTY INVESTIGATION:Unless  otherwise  specified  in  the  purchase  agreement  used,  the  physical\r\ncondition of the land and any improvements being purchased is not guaranteed by either Seller or Brokers. For this reason,(i)you\r\nshould conduct thorough inspections, investigations, tests, surveys and other studies (\"Investigations\") of the Property personally and\r\nwith professionals of your own choosing who should provide written reports of their findings and recommendations, and(ii)you\r\nshould not rely solely on reports provided by Seller or others. A general physical (home) inspection typically does not cover all\r\naspects  of  the  Property  nor  items  affecting  the  Property  that  are  not  physically  located  on  the  Property. If  any  professional\r\nrecommends additional Investigations, including a recommendation by a pest control operator to inspect inaccessible areas of the\r\nProperty, you should contact qualified experts to conduct such additional Investigations. 2. BUYER RIGHTS AND DUTIES:You have an affirmative duty to exercise reasonable care to protect yourself, including discovery\r\nofthe legal, practical and technical implications of disclosed facts, and to investigate and verify information and facts that you know or\r\nthat are within your diligent attention and observation. If the purchase agreement gives you the right to investigate the Property the\r\nbest way to protect yourself is to exercise this right. However, you must do so in accordance with the terms of, and time specified\r\nin, thatagreement. It is extremely important for you to read all written reports/disclosures provided by professionals and to discuss the\r\nresults of Investigations with the professionals who conducted the Investigations. 3.

A general physical inspection typically does not cover all aspects of the Property nor items affecting the\r\nProperty that are not physically located on the Property. If the professionals recommend further investigations,\r\nincluding a recommendation by a pest control operator to inspect inaccessible areas of the Property, you should\r\ncontact qualified experts to conduct such additional investigations. 2.

A. IMPORTANCE OF PROPERTY INVESTIGATION:Unless otherwise specified in the Agreement, the physical condition of the land and\r\nimprovements being purchased is not guaranteed by either Seller or Brokers. A Broker's inspection is limited visual inspection (see\r\nC.A.R. Form AVID); a Broker is not qualified to conduct the inspections listed below nor will Broker conduct these inspections checked\r\nby Buyer. For these reasons, you should conduct thorough inspections, investigations, tests, surveys and other studies (Inspections) of\r\nthe Property personally and with appropriate professionals (see C.A.R. Form BIA and SBSA) who should provide written reports of\r\ntheir Inspections. A general physical inspection typically does not cover all aspects of the Property nor items affecting the Property that\r\nare not physically located on the Property. If any professional recommends further Inspections, including a recommendation by a pest\r\ncontrol operator to inspect inaccessible areas of the Property, you should contact qualified experts to conduct such additional\r\nInspections. B. BUYER RIGHTS AND DUTIES:You have an affirmative duty to exercise reasonable care to protect yourself, including discovery of\r\nthe legal, practical and technical implications of disclosed facts, and to investigate and verify information and facts that you know or\r\nthat are within your diligent attention and observation. The Agreement gives you the right to investigate the Property. If you exercise\r\nthis right, and you should, you must do so in accordance with the terms of the Agreement. This is the best way for you to protect\r\nyourself. It is extremely important for you to read all written reports provided by professionals and to discuss the results of Inspections\r\nwith the professional who conducted the Inspection. C. BROKER ADVICE: YOU ARE STRONGLY ADVISED TO INVESTIGATE THE CONDITION AND SUITABILITY OF ALL ASPECTS\r\nOF THE PROPERTY. IF YOU DO NOT DO SO, YOU ARE ACTING AGAINST THE ADVICE OF BROKERS.

(For example, if the purchase price in the offer is $1,000,000, and Buyer reduces the appraisal contingency value to $950,000,\r\nthe\" Appraisal Gap\" is $50,000.

Form BHIA, 12/23)\r\n1. IMPORTANCE OF OBTAINING PROPERTY INSURANCE:If the property you are purchasing is destroyed or damaged\r\ndue to natural disaster or accident or some other event, insurance may be available to help with the cost of repair or\r\nrebuilding. In the absence of property insurance, the homeowner would be responsible for the full expense. If the property\r\nis purchased with a loan, or refinanced, the lender will require an insurance policy protecting its interest. Insurance\r\npolicies can cover damage due to one or more of the following: fire, flood, earthquake and other causes. The policy or\r\nan insurance broker should be consulted to determine when coverage applies and whether a supplement or rider can be\r\npurchased to provide additional coverage or if a separate policy is necessary. 2. PROPERTY INSURANCE AND PURCHASE CONTRACT TERMS:Your real estate purchase contract may contain a\r\ncontingency that gives you the right to legally cancel the agreement within a specified time if you are unable to obtain or\r\nafford property insurance. This cancellation right may be part of an overall investigation contingency or may be a specific\r\ncontingency pertaining to insurance. If buyer waives or removes the applicable contingency before determining the\r\navailability and cost of property insurance, buyer is acting against the advice of broker. 3. CALIFORNIA'S PROPERTY INSURANCE MARKET:Some insurance carriers in California have stopped issuing new\r\nproperty insurance policies and others are limiting the number and location of new policies. These changes may affect\r\nboth the availability and cost of insurance. However, over 50 insurance carriers are admitted to sell property insurance in\r\nCalifornia so it may be possible to obtain insurance even if some carriers will not write a new policy covering the property\r\nyou intend to buy. An insurance broker may also be able to find a non-admitted insurance carrier offering to insure\r\nthe property you intend to buy. Because locating an affordable insurance policy could take time and effort, buyers are\r\nadvised to make all insurance inquiries as early in the home buying process as possible. 4. INSURANCE CONDITIONS:Many insurance carriers impose physical condition standards before issuing a policy, or\r\nreserve the right to cancel policies even after they are issued, if certain minimum standards are not confirmed in an\r\ninspection or otherwise.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT"},"553de9a3-564d-4034-b189-c4eb8ff2b99b":{"id_":"553de9a3-564d-4034-b189-c4eb8ff2b99b","metadata":{},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"Z1GthF/WisDS9MX8bvqzvWdbceBAYn+bjaoIVYTfI4Q=","metadata":{},"hash":"8KQD8GAaX07vgpLy0q/HzL4X5d7pe/rVRhk/i3iG9+k="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"c4de1637-dd8c-4c2d-9753-e4503017890a","metadata":{},"hash":"4EZzztFdHTKZYWtNMoAtRQ5FsaL4rEg/5JZZ/vyt1RU="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"dbd441dc-a2bb-484b-8fe0-3186f9bf2df9","metadata":{},"hash":"EwrvJnekB+arb/xL3MkhOGmg179uJGg01EvbPPqltPo="}},"hash":"HVpOOVyXb2WscfkS44rU5jQwp0ovTUhAhtf9m4Hd254=","text":"Physical conditions standards could include, but are not limited to, prohibition of “knob and tube”\r\nelectrical wiring, requirements related to piping/plumbing materials, standards related to the age and/or quality of the roof\r\nor foundation, minimal safety standards related to handrails, tripping hazards, and defensible space requirements. 5.
