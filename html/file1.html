<br><p id='6' style='font-size:18px'>When you enter into a discussion with a real estate agent regarding a real estate transaction, you should from the outset understand<br>what type of agency relationship or representation you wish to have with the agent in the transaction.</p>
<br><p id='7' style='font-size:20px'>SELLER'S AGENT</p>
<br><p id='8' style='font-size:20px'>A Seller's agent under a listing agreement with the Seller acts as the agent for the Seller only. A Seller's agent or a subagent of that<br>agent has the following affirmative obligations:</p>
<br><p id='9' style='font-size:20px'>To the Seller: A Fiduciary duty of utmost care, integrity, honesty and loyalty in dealings with the Seller.<br>To the Buyer and the Seller:</p>
<br><p id='10' style='font-size:20px'>(a) Diligent exercise of reasonable skill and care in performance of the agent's duties.<br>(b) A duty of honest and fair dealing and good faith.<br>(c) A duty to disclose all facts known to the agent materially affecting the value or desirability of the property that are not known to,<br>or within the diligent attention and observation of, the parties. An agent is not obligated to reveal to either party any confidential<br>information obtained from the other party that does not involve the affirmative duties set forth above.</p>
<br><p id='11' style='font-size:20px'>BUYER'S AGENT</p>
<br><p id='12' style='font-size:18px'>A Buyer's agent can, with a Buyer's consent, agree to act as agent for the Buyer only. In these situations, the agent is not the Seller's<br>agent, even if by agreement the agent may receive compensation for services rendered, either in full or in part from the Seller. An agent<br>acting only for a Buyer has the following affirmative obligations:</p>
<br><p id='13' style='font-size:20px'>To the Buyer: A fiduciary duty of utmost care, integrity, honesty and loyalty in dealings with the Buyer.<br>To the Buyer and the Seller:</p>
<br><p id='14' style='font-size:20px'>(a) Diligent exercise of reasonable skill and care in performance of the agent's duties.<br>(b) A duty of honest and fair dealing and good faith.<br>(c) A duty to disclose all facts known to the agent materially affecting the value or desirability of the property that are not known to,<br>or within the diligent attention and observation of, the parties. An agent is not obligated to reveal to either party any confidential<br>information obtained from the other party that does not involve the affirmative duties set forth above.</p>
<br><p id='15' style='font-size:20px'>AGENT REPRESENTING BOTH SELLER AND BUYER</p>
<br><p id='16' style='font-size:20px'>A real estate agent, either acting directly or through one or more salespersons and broker associates, can legally be the agent of both<br>the Seller and the Buyer in a transaction, but only with the knowledge and consent of both the Seller and the Buyer.<br>In a dual agency situation, the agent has the following affirmative obligations to both the Seller and the Buyer:</p>
<p id='17'></p>
<br><p id='18' style='font-size:20px'>(a) A fiduciary duty of utmost care, integrity, honesty and loyalty in the dealings with either the Seller or the Buyer.<br>(b) Other duties to the Seller and the Buyer as stated above in their respective sections.</p>
<br><p id='19' style='font-size:20px'>In representing both Seller and Buyer, a dual agent may not, without the express permission of the respective party, disclose to the<br>other party confidential information, including, but not limited to, facts relating to either the Buyer's or Seller's financial position,<br>motivations, bargaining position, or other personal information that may impact price, including the Seller's willingness to accept a price<br>less than the listing price or the Buyer's willingness to pay a price greater than the price offered.</p>
<br><p id='20' style='font-size:18px'>SELLER AND BUYER RESPONSIBILITIES</p>
<br><p id='21' style='font-size:20px'>Either the purchase agreement or a separate document will contain a confirmation of which agent is representing you and whether that<br>agent is representing you exclusively in the transaction or acting as a dual agent. Please pay attention to that confirmation to make sure<br>it accurately reflects your understanding of your agent's role.</p>
<br><p id='22' style='font-size:18px'>The above duties of the agent in a real estate transaction do not relieve a Seller or Buyer from the responsibility to protect his or her<br>own interests. You should carefully read all agreements to assure that they adequately express your understanding of the transaction. A<br>real estate agent is a person qualified to advise about real estate. If legal or tax advice is desired, consult a competent professional.</p>
<br><p id='23' style='font-size:18px'>If you are a Buyer, you have the duty to exercise reasonable care to protect yourself, including as to those facts about the property</p>
<br><p id='24' style='font-size:18px'>which are known to you or within your diligent attention and observation.</p>
<br><p id='25' style='font-size:20px'>Both Sellers and Buyers should strongly consider obtaining tax advice from a competent professional because the federal and state tax<br>consequences of a transaction can be complex and subject to change.</p>
<br><p id='26' style='font-size:18px'>Throughout your real property transaction you may receive more than one disclosure form, depending upon the number of agents<br>assisting in the transaction. The law requires each agent with whom you have more than a casual relationship to present you with this<br>disclosure form. You should read its contents each time it is presented to you, considering the relationship between you and the real<br>estate agent in your specific transaction. This disclosure form includes the provisions of Sections 2079.13 to 2079.24, inclusive,<br>of the Civil Code set forth on page 2. Read it carefully.
